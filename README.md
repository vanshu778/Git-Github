# Git and GitHub Tutorial

## What is Git?

**Git** is a version control system that helps track changes to files and enables collaboration with others. It manages the history of your code and allows you to merge changes from different branches.

If terms like version control, branches, and merges are new to you, don't worry! We'll cover these concepts in this tutorial.

## Difference Between Git and GitHub

- **Git**: A software-based version control system, free and open source, available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. It helps you track and manage changes to your files locally.
- **GitHub**: A web-based platform where you can host Git repositories. It allows developers to collaborate, share code, and use Git in the cloud. Alternatives like **GitLab** and **Bitbucket** exist.

## Version Control Systems (VCS)

A **Version Control System (VCS)** is crucial in software development for managing the history of your code. It allows you to:
- Track changes to files
- Create checkpoints (versions) to which you can return if needed
- Collaborate with other developers without losing progress

### Why Use a VCS?
Think of it like a video game checkpointâ€”you can always return to a previous point if something goes wrong.

## Evolution of Version Control Systems

Before Git, developers used systems like **SCCS (Source Code Control System)**, which was proprietary and not user-friendly. Git was created as a more accessible, open-source solution. Other VCS tools include:
- **Subversion (SVN)**
- **CVS**
- **Perforce**

## Learning Path for Git and GitHub

To master Git and GitHub, follow these steps:
1. **Get the basics**
2. **Use it daily**
3. **Face problems**
4. **Solve them**
5. **Learn more**

We'll focus on Git first, then move to GitHub for easier collaboration and hosting.

## Installing Git

Git is available for:
- **Windows**
- **macOS**
- **Linux**

You can install Git by downloading it from the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/), or via the command line depending on your operating system.

## Setting Up GitHub Account

To start using GitHub:
1. Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
2. Link GitHub to your local machine through **SSH key setup** for enhanced security. (Password authentication is no longer recommended for pushing code to GitHub.)

## Git Concepts in Simple Terms

### Checkpoints (Version Control)
Git allows you to create **checkpoints** in your software development process. If something goes wrong, you can roll back to an earlier point, a core feature of version control.

### Git Flexibility
With Git, you can:
- Jump between different points in your code (checkpoints)
- Make changes and either commit or discard them as required

## Conclusion

Git and GitHub are essential tools for modern software development. Start by understanding the basics of Git, practice daily, troubleshoot issues, and gradually enhance your knowledge of GitHub for better collaboration and project hosting.
